Early one morning I left my home and headed to the Flughafen.
Afterwards, I visited a local baeckerei and purchased brot.
Then I rented a Porsche to go drive the Nurburgring.
Once the event was done, I picked up my hund and drove around Berlin.
But then my car’s klimaanlage went out so I decided to stop and cool off at a biergarten.
I walked into the biergarten, and realized I was the only one there not in lederhose!
While I was there, I became very hungry and purchased some brot and gebaeck to eat.
Then I saw an old friend, Mehlhase! She ordered some Apfelkuchen.
Melhase told me back in the day, she ate apfelkuchen as a wettbewerbsfaehig eater.
